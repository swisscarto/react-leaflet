# Example of a very simple Leaflet map within React

This small project shows how to create a Leaflet map from within React.

We use the Leaflet library directly, without any wrapping layer. For simple Leaflet map it would be better and easier to just use ready Leaflet components such as those in the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) project. 

When using Leaflet directly inside React, we have to maintain the whole map status and lifecycle manually. However, we are more flexible for using additionnal features.
